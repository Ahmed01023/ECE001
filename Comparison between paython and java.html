    <td>Python is an object-oriented programming language that is high-level, easy-to-learn, open-source,
     and extendable (OOP). Python is a programming language that may be used to control the performance of 
   various programmes, including Blender. Python is an interpreted, adaptable language that is extensively 
 used in many disciplines, including constructing independent programmes with graphical interfaces and in online applications.</td>
     <td>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
      implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application
       developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support
        Java without the need for recompilation</td>
